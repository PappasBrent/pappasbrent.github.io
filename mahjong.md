## Gameplay

- Shuffle the tiles face-down
- Assemble the tiles into a square with 17 2-tile stacks per "wall" (side)

![A Mahjong board after setup. Each "wall" consists of 17 2-tile stacks. Turn
  order begins with player 1 and proceeds
  counter-clockwise.](/assets/img/table.svg.png)

- Each player then picks 13 tiles
  - Except for the first player, who receives 14
- The starting player then discards a tile by moving it from their hand to the
  middle of the table
- Play proceeds counter-clockwise
- On your turn, you must do two things:
  1. Draw a tile from the middle
     - You must draw the tiles _in order_, i.e., from the ends of the walls
  2. Discard a tile

## Goal of the game

- Win with 4 sets of 3 and 1 pair
- A pair can be any two identical tiles
  - Same value and suit
- A set of 3 can be formed in 2 different ways
  - Triples: 3 identical tiles
  - Straights: 3 tiles of the same suit in sequential order (e.g., 1, 2, and 3)
- Once you have acquired the last tile of your winning hand, you do not discard
  a tile

## Pong and chow

- If a player discards a tile that you want, you can say "pong" or "chow" and
  take that tile
  - If you choose to do this, you must do it the moment that player discards
    the tile
- Pong versus chow
  - You can say "pong" and take a just-discarded tile whenever any player
    discards a tile, but only when it completes a triple for you. This ends
    your turn, and then play continues with the player after you
  - You can say "chow" and take a just-discarded tile whenever the player
    directly to your left discards a tile, but only when it completes a
    straight for you. This ends your turn, and then play continues with the
    player after you
  - After taking a tile with pong or chow, you must discard a tile to ensure
    there are only 13 tiles in your hand
  - When you complete a set with pong or chow, then you must reveal the
    completed set for the rest of the game

## Optional rules

- You can say "kong" and take a just-discarded tile whenever any player
  discards a tile, but only when it completes a set of 4 identical tiles for
  you. You do not discard a tile afterwards
  - With a kong, you must win with a 15-tile hand, since you still need three
    sets and one pair to win, and a kong only counts as one set
- You can also try to win with a hand of 7 pairs
  - This is very risky
- Your Mahjong set may include flower, season, and blank tiles
  - Remove the blank tiles before playing
  - If you draw a flower or season tile from a wall, then immediately discard
    it, and then draw another tile to replace it
