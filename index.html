        <p>
            I am a graduate student at the University of Central Florida (UCF) pursuing a PhD in Computer Science.
            My advisor is <a href="https://paulgazzillo.com/">Dr. Paul Gazzillo</a>.
            My research focus is on transforming C macros to C functions.

        <h2>What I'm Into</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Programming languages.
                I have been programming since high school, and genuinely enjoy learning about programming languages.
                From scripting languages like Python to formal proof assistants like Coq, I am familiar with a broad array of languages and language paradigms.
                My overall research goal is to use programming language theory to improve existing software development tools.
                By improving existing tools, developers can create more secure, reliable, and performant software.
            </li>
            <li>Reading. One book I would strongly recommend is <i>Sapiens</i> by Professor Yuval Noah Harari.</li>
            <li>Exercising. I enjoy playing tennis and going to the gym with friends.</li>
            <li>Video games and card games.</li>
        </ul>
