        <p>I am a graduate student at the University of Central Florida (UCF) pursuing a PhD in Computer Science. My
            advisor is <a href="https://paulgazzillo.com/">Dr. Paul Gazzillo</a>.</p>
        <p>I currently work as a graduate research assistant at UCF. I am currently focusing my research efforts on
            designing a means to convert C preprocessor usage to C language constructs. My research is related
            to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/checked-c/">Checked C</a>, Microsoft Research's
            dialect of C that ensures spatial memory safety; and <a

            <a href="https://correctcomputation.com/">Correct Computation Inc.</a>'s' tool for
            semi-automatic
            conversion from regular C code to Checked C code.

        <h2>What I'm Into</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Programming languages (shocking, I know)
                <ul>
                    <li>Python. I mainly use Python to automate tedious tasks in my life or to solve programming
                        problems in
                        my free time, but I have experience developing <a
                            href="http://www.dollarsfordrs.com">websites</a>
                        and <a href="https://rapidapi.com/PappasBrent/api/periodic-table-of-elements/">APIs</a> in
                        Flask.
                    </li>
                    <li>JavaScript. This is the language I usually use for web development. My most recent large project
                        made in
                        JS is <a href="http://www.pallet-town.me">Pallet Town</a>, a tool to help
                        people play the Pokemon Trading Card Game online via <a
                            href="https://www.tabletopsimulator.com/">Tabletop Simulator</a>. I've also made a bunch of
                        games in JS, click the link at the top of the page to if you would like to try some of them.
                    </li>
                    <li>Rust. I'm still only learning Rust (it's hard!), but I am really enjoying it so far. My only
                        project made with Rust as of yet is an emulator for the CHIP-8 virtual machine. It's open
                        source, so please peruse the code
                        <a href="https://github.com/PappasBrent/rust-chip-8-emulator">on GitHub</a>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Go. Similarly to Rust, I would say that I am still learning Go. Go is much simpler however, so
                        within two months of first picking up the language I used it to create an <a
                            href="https://card-fight-vanguard-api.ue.r.appspot.com/">API for the trading
                            card game Cardfight!! Vanguard</a>. If this sounds interesting to you, please check out
                        its <a href="https://card-fight-vanguard-api.ue.r.appspot.com/api/v1/docs">documentation</a>.
                    </li>
                    <li>C, Java, Haskell, Erlang. These are mainly languages that I've learned just for university
                        classes. I tutored CS 1 in C and Object Oriented Programming in Java for about a year at UCF, so
                        I'm decently familiar with them.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Reading. One book I would strongly recommend is <i>Sapiens</i> by Professor Yuval Noah Harari.</li>
            <li>Running.</li>
            <li>Board games and card games.</li>
            <li>Juggling <big>ü§π‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</big>.</li>
