        <p>
        I am a Computer Science PhD student at the University of Central Florida (UCF)
        studying under <a href="https://paulgazzillo.com/">Dr. Paul Gazzillo</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
        <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10548673">Much of my PhD
            research</a> has focused on translating C preprocessor macros to C code in
        order to better enable existing C translators to translate real-world C
        programs to safer programming languages such as Rust.
        </p>

        <p>
        In the past year, I have also been conducting live studies of three-person
        debugging teams to determine what makes for effective team debugging.
        </p>

        <p>
        <a href="/research/hardening-build-systems">Most recently</a>, I have been
        researching techniques to analyze software build systems in order to detect and
        prevent build system attacks.
