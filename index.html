<h2>What I'm Into</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Programming languages.
        I have been programming since high school, and genuinely enjoy learning about programming languages.
        From scripting languages like Python to formal proof assistants like Coq, I am familiar with a broad array of languages and language paradigms.
        My overall research goal is to develop tools that use make it easier for software developers to craft robust, secure software.
