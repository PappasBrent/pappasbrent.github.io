This month, I have began a new routine; or perhaps it would be more
appropriate to call it a ritual.

Each Saturday morning, I drive to a nearby
gas station that server freshly ground coffee. After refueling my car with
gas, I refuel myself on some nice warm bean juice. I don't drink coffee
most days of the week, so this is quite a treat for me. I then drive back
to my place, sit down at my computer and, with cup of coffee in tow, immerse
myself in a task of my choosing (usually programming related).
While in this flow state, I am able to think clearly and work efficiently.
Though I greatly enjoy the company of others and collaborating with my
peers on larger projects, this time of solitude is an event that I look
forward to each week.

I was able to identify this time as a ritual worth repeating in part because
of a book that I read this month: *The 5 A.M. Miracle*, by Jeff Sanders.
This short but pragmatic read was recommended to me by a former supervisor
of mine, Ms. Patricia Hartley at UCF (she was my coordinator back when I
was a Computer Science and Object-Oriented Programming tutor at UCF's
Student Academic Resource Center). This book contains a trove of advice for
those who are just getting-started in the world of self-improvement, and
overall I would recommend it to anyone who wants to take the first step
towards achieving some of their life's "grandest goals" (a phrase that
Sanders employs frequently in the book).

The biggest takeaway for me from this work is the idea of setting quarterly
goals. I tend to set daily and weekly goals for myself, but have never set
quarterly goals. Some of my favorite content creators, such as
[Kyle Cook](https://blog.webdevsimplified.com/) from the YouTube channel
*Web Dev Simplified* set quarterly goals for themselves, so reading this in
Sanders' book has brought the concept to the forefront of my mind
(As an aside, if you would like a grittier, more extreme take on
self-improvement, then you may want to check out *Can't Hurt Me* by David
Goggins). That being said, I want to start setting quarterly goals for
myself, and will start with the three goals I would like to have finished
by the end of next month.

The first is to pass Senior Design, as passing that class is critical to my
graduating from UCF with my Bachelor's. I don't want to provide too much
detail in this post, but earlier this month I ran some quick numbers on the
efficiency of my team's solution to our sponsor's problem, and the results
were disheartening. Following the advice of one of my senior design
professors, Dr. Richard Leinecker, I created a hundred test cases
to obtain quantitative measures of our solution's time efficiency and
accuracy. Our team then collaborated intensely in the following weeks to
vastly improve the algorithms our code uses, and now I am proud to say that
we have a new solution that is orders of magnitude superior to the original.
The icing on top is that we now have a preponderance of quantitative data
to explain why our team chose the methods we did to solve the problem, and
demonstrate its efficiency.

The second goal is to succeed at my first foray into research with Dr.
Gazzillo involving Checked C and 3C. I have spent the last few weeks
conducting more research on these topics, reading some of the issues in the
3C repo, and dipping my toes into LLVM. It would be untrue of me to say that
I am totally comfortable with all of this new knowledge, but I plan to zero
in on the parts that confuse me most so that I may quickly learn the skills
needed to meaningfully contribute to these projects.

My final goal is to finish a personal project of mine that I began last
month. I want to keep this last one a secret, but I will say that it is
written in Go and involves card games ðŸ™‚.

Anyway, I read one other book since my last post, *Autoportrait* by
Ã‰douard LevÃ©, and have started a second one, *The Idea Factory* by Pepper
White. The former was recommended to me by a cousin of mine, and is quite
unlike anything else I have ever read. It is essentially a series of random
thoughts by the author, presented one after another. I initially found
this style of writing difficult to parse, but as I read more of it I became
attuned to the occasionally poignant messages that LevÃ© perforates the book
with (at times, I suspect, inadvertently). The latter work was suggested
to me by Dr. Gazzillo, and is a more traditional autobiography. It relates
the life of an aspiring Masters student at MIT, and so far has presented
the university as quite an intimidating place due to the social, scholastic,
and economic pressures that its attendees face.

That's all for this month. Next month I hope to write a post celebrating my
achievement of the three goals outlined above!

P.S. I know it hasn't quite been a month since my last post but I feel that
enough has happened since then to warrant another update prior to the Ides
of March. Furthermore, I have decided to shift my monthly blog posting
schedule to once at the end of each month instead of the first week of
each month. I feel that these posts are a great way to reflect on a month
of accomplishments and obstacles; therefore it makes more sense to me
to write and publish them at each month's conclusion.
