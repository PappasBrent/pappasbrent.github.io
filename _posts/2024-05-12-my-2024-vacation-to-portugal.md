After attending ICSE a few weeks ago, my girlfriend and I had a blast exploring
in and around Lisbon, Portugal. Here are all the places we visited, as well my
brief thoughts on them.

<!-- TODO: Change the publication date! -->

## Museums

- 3D Fun Art Museum Lisboa: This museum had a few funny illusions that made for
  some great photos (which are little too silly for me to want to share haha).

- Calouste Gulbenkian Museum: Tucked away in a library, this musuem was replete
  with artifacts from cultures all across the globe! We started exploring this
  musuem in the afternoon, but spent so long admiring everything that the museum
  staff had to kick us out before we could finish walking through the last
  section on European history.

- Mosteiro dos Jerónimos: Large and honestly somewhat imposing, this monastery
  is one of the most conspicuous historical sites in Lisbon. It's kept in great
  condition though, partly because the city only lets people in to explore the
  site in groups of about 30 people at a time. This also made it easier for my
  girlfriend and I to get some great pictures, such as this one of the monastery
  courtyard:

- Museu da Marioneta: This was actually the first museum we visited, and it was
  very funny and quirky. At the end we got to watch the Portuguese stop motion
  classic, [_A Suspeita_](https://youtu.be/m4Fciq8LPz0?si=BOT5RHJkdAnmoTkI), and
  it was great.

- The Museum of Art, Architecture, and Technology (MAAT): This musuem presented
  a look into the industrial history of Lisbon, and into global efforts towards
  a more sustainable future.

- The Museum of the Orient: This was our favorite museum. There were just so
  many artifacts (snuff bottles, paintings, dresses, suits of armor, and more!)
  that we didn't have time to appreciate it all before the musuem closed and the
  staff told us to leave. Oh well, on the bright side we got in for free because
  we apparently came on International Day.

- The National Tile Museum: So many pretty tiles.

## Historical sites and landmarks

- Aqueduto das Águas Livres: Honestly the aqueduct is not that pretty to look
  at, but it's massive size is impressive, and its location above the highway
  makes it a great spot for taking photos.

- Arco da Rua Augusta: Crowds of people were flocking to this iconic site when
  we stopped by it, and there was even a guy with a bubble wand blowing a ton of
  bubbles!

- Belém Tower: We didn't go inside but the outside was cool. My girlfriend
  painted a picture of the tower one day while I was at ICSE.

- Centro Cultural de Belém: This was the ICSE 2024 conference venue.

- National Palace of Pena: Pena Palace was probably the most beautiful
  historical site we saw, and definitely the most colorful. This is because it
  was built much more recently that the other historical sites (in the 1800s),
  and also appears to be better well-maintained. To get to the palace, we
  decided to forgo taking the bus and hiked up the mountain it is perched on
  ourselves. This took about an hour, but the climb was worth it in the end.
  Afterward we had a nice time exploring the palace gardens (although the
  greenhouses were in disrepair), and finally took a semi-hidden side-trail to
  climb back down the mountain. The whole experience felt somewhat magical.

- Padrão dos Descobrimentos: An interesting monument to the discovery of America
  and the New World. The cool thing about this monument is that one side of it
  faces the East and the other faces the West, so if you go in the morning or
  the evening, you may want to visit it again at the other time of day so that
  you can see the sun shine on the other side.

- Palace Fronteira: We only explored the outside, and while it was somewhat
  overgrown, the nautically-themed tiles were striking, and the maze-like garden
  was good for a stroll.

- São Jorge Castle: This castle is almost worth visiting for the view alone. It
  sits atop a high hill in Lisbon and thus offers a great view of the city. The
  castle itself is honestly rather rugged, and the stairs are steep, slippery,
  and narrow, but I think that gives you a better idea of what it must have been
  like for the soldiers who resided here in the past. There's also a museum next
  to the castle that has some neat artifacts that are worth checking out.

- Sé de Lisboa: This immense church has many gorgeous sites, but a few things
  that stick out to me are the pope's dressing room (so much of it is gilded
  that it almost looks like the room is made of gold), a large nativity scene
  diorama, and the church's huge pipe organ.

## Nature sites

- Cabo da Roca: Absolutely breathtaking. We traveled to the westernmost point of
  continental Europe after visiting Pena Palace, and the view totally blew me
  away. The ocean seemed to stretch on endlessly toward the horizon, and the
  waves undulated gently under the sun like a sleepy serpent. This was
  definitely my favorite part of the trip.

- Parque da Pedra: This park was fun to explore. On the side of the park close
  to the aqueduct, we saw some cute wooden scupltures!

- Tropical Botanical Garden of Lisbon: The front of the park is nice but
  unfortunately the rest of it was kind of run down and gross.

## Restaurants and dining

- Encanto: This Michelin star vegan restaurant was fantastic. It was our first
  time eating at a Michelin restaurant so I didn't know what to expect. The
  dinner turned out to be a nine-course meal, with many of the dishes being
  one-bite wonders. I enjoyed every second of it. All the dishes were works of
  art, and my girlfriend and I tried the non-alcoholic and alcoholic
  drink-pairings, respectively. At the very end, our waiter even gave us a
  wax-sealed letter listing the evening's menu to help us remember our
  experience.

- Legumi Sushi Vegan: This place was as true hidden gem. We dined here one night
  early on in our trip, and tried the small sushi boat. It was delicious, and
  the staff (who were very friendly!) even gave us a free dessert! On our last
  day in Lisbon we returned here, ordered the large sushi boat, and managed to
  finish it!

- Time Out Market: Part fish market, part farmer's market, and part food court,
  Time Out Market was quite a fun place to explore for an hour or two. We didn't
  even get a chance to explore upstairs, which from below appeared to be a plant
  nursery.

- LX Factory: ICSE's conference banquet was hosted at an empty warehouse in this
  art district, and while it looked really cool, the banquet was uncomfortably
  packed and the restaurant my girlfriend and I tried to escape to was
  unfortunately overpriced. If we go back to Lisbon though I would like to check
  this place out again; it looked really cool and I bet some of its other
  restaurants are better.

## Shopping

- Campo Pequeno: This mall was small and the upper floor was basically closed.
  My girlfriend liked the exterior look of the place but honestly I was not that
  impressed.

- Colombo Shopping Centre: This three-story mall was a lot of fun to walk
  around. We purchased some nice apparel for cheaper than we would have in the
  United States, and explored a cool home decorating store named _Area
  Infinity_.

- Pingo Doce: I would be remiss not to mention one of Portugal's biggest
  supermarkets! We stopped in a few of these for snacks.
