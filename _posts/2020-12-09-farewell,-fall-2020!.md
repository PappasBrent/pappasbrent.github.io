Today I finished my last exam of this semester. Hurray! I am excited for Winter Break and the holidays 🎅

I decided to celebrate by starting a book that I purchased recently and have
been wanting to read for a while now:
[_The Mythical Man-Month_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month),
by [Frederick P. Brooks, Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Brooks)
![Mythical Man-Month Book Cover](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Mythical_man-month_%28book_cover%29.jpg){:class="float-right m-4"}

I know the gist of the book is that simply adding more manpower to a large
software development project generally (read: nearly always) is not a good idea
when trying to get the project out to production quicker. Instead, the goal
should be on forming a compact team with well-defined roles. This minimizes
the need to communicate with a many different members of a team and helps
each member stay focused on their own task.

At least, that's what I've garnered
so far. I just finished the 4th chapter this morning. I think the idea of
structuring a software development team
[like a surgical team](https://www.historicprojects.com/Harlan_Mills.html)
is great, and I can see how it may have inspired such practices as
pair programming. I'll make another post if I find any other ideas in the book
that I would like to discuss (which is not unlikely 🤓).

In other news, I made some site updates today. For one thing, the site now has a
[sitemap](/sitemap.xml) to improve search engine optimization. Also, the
site's protocol is now HTTPS! GitHub Pages made this extremely easy to set up 🙂
Finally, the site now has it's own favicon. Take a peek at it in your browser's tab.
