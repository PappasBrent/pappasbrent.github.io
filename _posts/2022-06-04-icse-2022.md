Last week I attended my first conference: the [44th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2022)](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icse-2022).
I had a great time!
I attended quite a few interesting talks, formed new connections with other researchers, and even explored some of Pittsburgh.

The ICSE organizers this year restricted each presentation to five minutes.
While this wasn't a popular decision amongst many of the attendees, it enabled many talks to be packed into a short period of time.
My favorite single presentation was [Courtney Miller's talk on toxicity in open source discussions](https://conf.researchr.org/details/icse-2022/icse-2022-papers/74/-Did-You-Miss-My-Comment-or-What-Understanding-Toxicity-in-Open-Source-Discussions).
I think Courtney did a great job of working with the limited presentation time by making the talk fast-paced and easy to understand.

My favorite technical talk was [Michael Coblenz's talk on Bronze, a garbage collector for Rust](https://conf.researchr.org/details/icse-2022/icse-2022-papers/70/Garbage-Collection-Makes-Rust-Easier-to-Use-A-Randomized-Controlled-Trial-of-the-Bro).
This talk was fairly technical, but Coblenz communicated his group's findings clearly and efficiently.

I am glad to say that I met a lot of great people at ICSE from all over world, such as Canada, Iceland, Germany, and Texas.
I especially enjoyed talking with Zachary Patterson and Austin Mordahl, both from UT Dallas.
Zach is the first author on [our paper that was accepted to ICSE](https://conf.researchr.org/details/icse-2022/icse-2022-papers/146/SugarC-Scalable-Desugaring-of-Real-World-Preprocessor-Usage-into-Pure-C), and presented an excellent talk and presentation for it.
While not at the conference, the three of us explored various parts of Pittsburgh, such as an art museum, a nature park, and a local bookstore.
I like exploring new places and had never been to Pennsylvania before, so discovering these places with my new friends was a lot fun.

I really enjoyed ICSE 2022, and hope to have a similar experience when I go to [PLDI](https://pldi22.sigplan.org/) in San Diego in a few weeks ðŸ™‚
I'll be sure to provide a debrief here after that conference as well, so be on the lookout for that!
