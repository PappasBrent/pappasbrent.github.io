        Here is a list of books and stories I recommend, sorted by title of the
        work in alphabetical order. Works in bold are ones I strongly recommend.
        I mostly read fiction. I have read more works than those listed here,
        but these are the ones I feel are the most worthy of my recommendation
        <small>or maybe just my praise :)</small>.

                    to live a life one may be proud of. While I consider it worth
                    reading, I think Dr. Peterson's podcast, especially his older
                    episodes in which he presents his lectures, are even more
                    valuable. I know not everyone who knows Jordan Peterson is a fan
                    of him (in fact, I'm not as interested in his works as I used to
                    be), but I think this work is still solid. It helped me better

                    quite a few bad things. Towards the end of the book, Burgess
                    "fixes" Alex and makes him permanently good. The way he does
                    though is so horrible that I found myself wondering if it would
                    be better if Alex just remained evil. Also, the book is full of

                    impressed. The prose was somewhat boring and the jokes fell
                    flat; probably because the story was originally written in
                    Japanese and I was reading an English translation. However, as I
                    kept reading, I found myself increasingly invested in Takezo and
                    his journey to become Musashi, the legendary swordsman. He puts
                    his life in danger many times, gives up all worldly pleasures,
                    and even turns down someone who loves him, all in pursuit of his
                    goal. He's insane in the same way that David Goggins is insane,
                    yet at the same time also admirable. In time I grew to
                    appreciate the book's simple prose, because its austerity
                    mirrored that of the novel's protagonist. Toward the end of the
                    book many of the characters lives have turned around for the
                    better, all thanks to Musashi and his sacrifices. However, this
                    comes at the cost of much human life. This is presently my
                    favorite book, though I don't think it's for everyone.</td>

                    of consumerism. I think the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic makes this

                <td>I recommend reading this for two reasons. The first reason
                is that I find Machiavelli's advice on personal integrity and
                self-improvement to be sound. Machiavelli wrote this essay for
                royalty, and encourages them to set high standards for
                themselves and their subjects. The other reason I recommend this
                work is to be able to recognize those would try to use
                Machiavelli's advice on manipulation to control you. It disturbs
                me to think that there may actually be people out there who try
                to psychologically manipulate others using some of Machiavelli's
                tactics, but since it is possible, you should arm yourself with
                this knowledge as well so you can defend against it.</td>

                America after a nuclear war is as soul-crushing as it is
                inspiring, and McCarthy's unique writing style suits it
                perfectly. There are some moments of peace, but they are few and
                fair between, and over the course of the story the two of them
                endure so much physical and emotional trauma that it's a miracle
                they have they will to keep going (although sometimes they
                barely do). Although this story is at times depressing, I
                believe it is a testament to the human spirit.</td>

                    greatest fictional story humanity has ever told, to arguing that
                    the invention of agriculture was a bad idea, to questioning what
                    the exact definition of <i>religion</i> is, Harari will almost
                    certainly challenge you. Reading this book gave me a broader
                    outlook on life, and made me realize that I wasn't as
                    open-minded as I thought I was.

                    people to form separate societies that can to coexist
                    peacefully. This theme is packaged in a story that is sort of
                    like a demented East of Eden: it has a large cast and biblical
                    themes, and involves the battle between good and evil. However
                    unlike East of Eden it takes place in post-apocalyptic America.

                    an English professor. To be blunt, most of his life sucks: his
                    wife hates him, his boss has it out for him, and his daughter
                    becomes an alcoholic. However, underneath all the apparent
                    suffering are undertones of love: his love for his parents, the
                    initial love he had for his wife, his everlasting love for his
                    daughter, and the short-lived but genuine love affair he has
                    with one of his students. The story ends in death, but it's
                    really about life.</td>

                <td>The primary reason is I like this book is because of its
                    main character, Okonkwo. He commits acts of violence due to a
                    misguided sense of virility, and then feels so remorseful about
                    doing so that he enter a near-catatonic state. He is a
                    perpetrator and victim of "toxic masculinity". I feel more
                    conflicted about him than any other fictional character.

                    I also enjoy this book because it provides a view into
                    African culture, of which I knew nothing before reading this
                    story. Achebe does an excellent jobs of making the reader
                    realize that what may be considered bad in one culture may
                    be considered good by another, and vice-versa.

                    because its narrator is so mysterious. He reveals more about
                    himself as the story goes on, but by the end I may have had more
