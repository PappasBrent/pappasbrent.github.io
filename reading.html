        Here is a list of books and stories I recommend, sorted by title of the
        work in alphabetical order. Works in bold are ones I strongly recommend.
        I mostly read fiction. I have read <a

        most worthy of my recommendation

                valuable. I know not everyone who knows Jordan Peterson is a fan

                quite a few bad things. Towards the end of the book, Burgess
                "fixes" Alex and makes him permanently good. The way he does

                <td><b>Gravity's Rainbow</b></td>
                <td>Thomas Pynchon</td>
                <td>
                    <i>Gravity's Rainbow</i> is <strong>by far</strong> the
                    best-written story I've ever read, but after reading it I
                    can't tell you what it's about. This is because the story
                    is, by design, extremely abstruse.
                    <br><br>
                    One of the reasons this book is so complex is because of its
                    many plotlines. Pynchon weaves myriad plots and characters
                    together in an onslaught of (mostly) unlabeled sections,
                    separated into four parts. Most of the book's plotlines span
                    several of these sections, which are often highly disjointed
                    (e.g. the first section of the book focuses on Captain
                    Pirate Prentice, and the next section to focus on Pirate
                    comes several hundred pages later). Some sections are
                    self-contained though, such as the story of the Byron the
                    immortal light-bulb. A few sections start suddenly and end
                    just as abruptly, such as the one about an American soldier
                    who gives his captain a haircut, and is secretly plotting to
                    kill him. Pynchon often also digresses into sub-plots and
                    imaginary scenarios that may span several pages in length,
                    making these sections even harder to follow. Pynchon will
                    reference the plots, sub-plots, characters, and even
                    literary devices he establishes in an earlier section in a
                    later section, even if the two sections don't belong to the
                    same plot line. Sometimes he will even do the reverse, and
                    allude to the events in a later section from an earlier
                    section. It's like <i>Catch-22</i>, but 10x more confusing.
                    These cross-referenced plots make <i>Gravity's Rainbow</i>
                    more difficult to read, but also much more rewarding.
                    <br><br>
                    Another reason that the work is so difficult to follow is
                    because of the wide range of topics it encompasses. If
                    Pynchon were to have just written this story in plain
                    English, it would have still been one of best-written books
                    I've read (and maybe still the best), because of his
                    exquisite mastery over the English language. However,
                    Pynchon couples his superior writing with the knowledge of a
                    variety of subjects such as math, music, psychology, and
                    history. For example, the sections about the statistician
                    Roger Mexico discuss Poisson distributions, and the sections
                    about the Nobel-prize hungry psychologist Pointsman often
                    feature Pavlovian conditioning. These aren't just
                    superficial nods to these concepts either; for example there
                    is one chapter where Pynchon spends several pages
                    philosophizing about integrals.
                    <br><br>
                    Finally, some may find <i>Gravity's Rainbow</i> difficult to
                    read simply because it is too obscene or flat-out weird.
                    Most of the characters spend a lot of time thinking about
                    either their job or about sex, and many characters have
                    strange, revolting fetishes. If you have a light stomach
                    then you may not be able to read this book. On other hand,
                    the book also features stories that are just gross or
                    strange. These stories include one about a giant adenoid,
                    one about cowboys that takes place in a toilet, and one
                    about alien pinballs that are traumatized by a
                    malfunctioning solenoid.
                    <br><br>
                    To conclude: if you like literature and are looking for a
                    challenge then I <strong>strongly</strong> recommend reading
                    Gravity's Rainbow.

                <td>When I first started reading Musashi, I wasn't too
                impressed. The prose was somewhat boring and the jokes fell
                flat; probably because the story was originally written in
                Japanese and I was reading an English translation. However, as I
                kept reading, I found myself increasingly invested in Takezo and
                his journey to become Musashi, the legendary swordsman. He puts
                his life in danger many times, gives up all worldly pleasures,
                and even turns down someone who loves him, all in pursuit of his
                goal. He's insane in the same way that David Goggins is insane,
                yet at the same time also admirable. In time I grew to
                appreciate the book's simple prose, because its austerity
                mirrored that of the novel's protagonist. Toward the end of the
                book many of the characters lives have turned around for the
                better, all thanks to Musashi and his sacrifices. However, this
                comes at the cost of much human life. This is presently my
                favorite book, though I don't think it's for everyone.</td>

                of consumerism. I think the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic makes this

                <td>In truth I find it difficult to describe <i>Pale Fire</i>,
                but I'll do my best. The book <i>Pale Fire</i> consists of four
                parts: a foreword, a 999-line long poem (also called "Pale
                Fire"), a commentary on the poem, and an index. Most of the book
                is devoted to the commentary, and you'll have to flip back and
                forth between it and the poem to progress through the book. This
                already makes <i>Pale Fire</i> harder to read than most books,
                but it gets worse (or better, depending on your perspective):
                the commentator is a complete narcisist that may or may not be
                the runaway king of a mystical northern land called Zembla
                which, in the fictional setting of <i>Pale Fire</i>, may or may
                not actually exist. For this reason, some herald this book as
                the ultimate example of the unreliable narrator trope. This book
                is very funny at times, though you'll have to be a bit clever to
                recognize some of the jokes (the one about hallitosis, for
                instance). If you like <i>Don Quixote</i>
                    or <i><span style="color: blue">House</span> of Leaves</i>,
                    then I would recommend picking this book up. While it's less
                    approachable than either of those two books (and that's
                    saying something considering how old the former is and how
                    medium-breaking the latter is), I think it's technically
                    better than either of them as well.

                royalty, and encourages them to set high standards for

                work is to be able to recognize those who would try to use
                Machiavelli's advice on manipulation to control you. It disturbs
                me to think that there may actually be people out there who try
                to psychologically manipulate others using some of Machiavelli's
                tactics, but since it is possible, you should arm yourself with
                this knowledge as well so you can defend against it.</td>

                perfectly. There are some moments of peace, but they are few and
                fair between, and over the course of the story the two of them
                endure so much physical and emotional trauma that it's a miracle
                they have they will to keep going (although sometimes they
                barely do). Although this story is at times depressing, I

                misguided sense of virility, and then feels so remorseful about
                doing so that he enter a near-catatonic state. He is a
                perpetrator and victim of "toxic masculinity". I feel more
                conflicted about him than any other fictional character.

                    I also enjoy this book because it provides a view into
                    African culture, of which I knew nothing before reading this
                    story. Achebe does an excellent job of making the reader
                    realize that what may be considered bad by one culture may
                    be considered good by another, and vice-versa.
