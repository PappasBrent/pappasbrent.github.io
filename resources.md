## Computer Programming

- [Bash man pages](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages//man1/bash.1.html): The
  manual pages for the GNU Bourne-Again SHell. If you program on Linux at all
  and haven't read this yet, do yourself a favor and give this a read. Most
  Linux machines come with Bash pre-installed, so by reading this text you'll
  be able to automate all sorts of tasks on many machines, without needing to
  rely on downloading an external programs like a Python interpreter. If you
  prefer to watch a video instead of read a book, then I recommend this [7 hour
  free course](https://youtu.be/Sx9zG7wa4FA?si=g_ESGl3Qu4FQAgqG) on YouTube.

- [Vim as your editor](https://youtu.be/X6AR2RMB5tE?si=nIZebfjlXAImcVpG):
  Michael Paulson, AKA ThePrimeagen, provides a series of entertaining and
  informative videos about how to use the Vim text editor.

- [The Big OOPs: Anatomy of a Thirty-five-year
  Mistake](https://youtu.be/wo84LFzx5nI?si=vdHoniya1luJa3-t): Casey Muratori
  examines the history of object-oriented programming in order to determine how
  the paradigm became so popular in the software engineering industry.

- [How I program C](https://youtu.be/443UNeGrFoM?si=k036mCS7rhieZAyA): Eskil
  Steenberg explains why he only writes code using the 1989 C standard, despite
  it being decades old.

## Writing

- [Style: Lessons in Clarity and
  Grace](https://www.amazon.com/Style-Lessons-Clarity-Grace-12th/dp/0134080416):
  Joseph Williams and Joseph Bizup give concrete advice on how to make your
  writing more clear and enjoyable to read. I link to the 12th edition here,
  but I would recommend picking up an older version from a site such as
  [AbeBooks](https://www.abebooks.com/) since that is likely to be more
  affordable.

- [The Elements of
  Style](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/37134/37134-h/37134-h.htm): William
  Strunk provides fundamental writing advice. I recommend reading a later
  edition, such as the 4th edition, for additional insights from E.B. White.

- [The Craft of Writing
  Effectively](https://youtu.be/vtIzMaLkCaM?si=Xv1-GPC9vH2TKr5T): Larry
  McEnerney, director emeritus of the University of Chicago Writing Program,
  argues that most academics were taught how to write incorrectly, and gives
  advice on how to fix this by persuading your readers that your work is
  valuable to them.

- [Politics and the English
  Language](https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/politics-and-the-english-language/):
  George Orwell's essay on writing is often touted by academics as a gold mine
  for writing advice, and although I think my above recommendations are
  superior, I concede that this essay has its merits. In particular, the advice
  about providing concrete examples is very useful.
